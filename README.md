# Project Description

This is a MakeUofT hackathon project where I built a convolutional neural network to predict the genre of a sample of music. I was following this [Youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wATfeyAMNrtbkCNsLcpoAyBBRJZVlnf) to learn how to use TensorFlow and apply it to audio signal processing. 

## Components and File Directory

The code can be found in [main.ipynb](https://github.com/RyanS07/music-genre-classifier/blob/main/main.ipynb) and the data set used to train and test the CNN can be found in [genres](https://github.com/RyanS07/music-genre-classifier/tree/main/genres).
